FCAI Scheduler:
FCAI Factor:
depends on:
- Priority (P)
- Arrival time (AT)
- Remaining brust time (RBT)

FCAI Factor = (10âˆ’Priority) + (Arrival Time/V1) + (Remaining Burst Time/V2)
- V1 = last arrival time of all processes/10
- V2 = max burst time of all processes/10

Quantum updates:
- Q = Q + 2 (if process completes its quantum and still has remaining work)
- Q = Q + unused quantum (if process is preempted)

Steps:
-> first calculate v1 = last arrival time, v2 = max burst time.
-> Calculate the FCAI Factor for all processes.
-> The process leaves the cpu when (Priority):
    - another process with low FCAI Factor enters
    - process finishes its quantum
